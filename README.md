# Sales_Prediction_Linear_Regression_Random_Forest_Regression

This repository contains the code and analysis for a sales prediction project. The project utilizes a dataset obtained from Kaggle, which can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harrimansaragih/dummy-advertising-and-sales-data).

## Project Overview

The main goal of this project is to predict sales based on advertising data. The following steps were performed:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** A thorough exploration of the dataset was conducted to understand its structure and characteristics.

2. **Data Preprocessing:** The dataset underwent preprocessing to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale numerical features.

3. **Data Visualization:** Various visualizations were created to gain insights into the relationships between different variables in the dataset.

4. **Model Building:**
   - **Linear Regression:** A linear regression model was implemented to predict sales based on the features in the dataset.
   - **Random Forest Regression:** A random forest regression model was also trained and evaluated for comparison.

5. **Results Comparison:** The results of the linear regression and random forest regression models were compared to determine the effectiveness of each model in predicting sales.

## Getting Started
